# Pg Server Pinger
So, it just a code that will ping my VPN server, so I'll be sure it is up
not only checking it from my/friends' PCs but also from different server

No, "Pg" comes NOT from postgres but that doesn't mean a lot

It just TCPings a server but URL ping through xray (signbox) is planned in future (maybe)
