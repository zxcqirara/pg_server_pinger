# Pg Server Pinger
So, it just a code that will ping my VPN server, so I'll be sure it is up
not only checking it from my/friends' PCs but also from different server

No, "Pg" comes NOT from postgres but that doesn't mean a lot

It just TCPings a server but URL ping through xray (signbox) is planned in future (maybe)

Some logs are written in Russian, you can fork this project, in case you need, and translate those ones to English or another language
